# HasGeoLookup Installation Complete

The HasGeoLookup gem migrations have been generated successfully!

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migrations:**
   ```bash
   bin/rails db:migrate
   ```

2. **For PostGIS users (recommended):**
   - Ensure PostGIS extension is available in your PostgreSQL database
   - The migrations will automatically enable PostGIS and create spatial indexes
   - This provides optimal performance for boundary queries and coordinate validation

3. **For non-PostGIS databases:**
   - The gem will work with MySQL, SQLite, or other databases
   - Spatial queries will be limited, but basic geographic lookup functionality remains available
   - Coordinate validation will use fallback methods instead of boundary containment

4. **Import geographic data:**
   ```bash
   # Import geoboundaries and geonames for a specific country (recommended)
   bin/rails geo:import[US]
   
   # Or import datasets separately
   bin/rails geoboundaries:import[US]  # Administrative boundaries
   bin/rails geonames:import[US]       # Geographic place names
   ```

5. **Include the concern in your models:**
   ```ruby
   class Listing < ApplicationRecord
     include HasGeoLookup
     
     # Your model must have latitude and longitude attributes
     # The gem will provide geographic lookup methods
   end
   ```

## Available Tables

The following tables have been created:

- **`geonames`** - Geographic place data from Geonames.org
- **`geoboundaries`** - Administrative boundary polygons from GeoBoundaries.org  
- **`feature_codes`** - Classification codes for geographic features
- **`metros`** - Custom metropolitan area definitions
- **`metros_geoboundaries`** - Join table linking metros to their constituent boundaries

## Key Features

- **Coordinate validation** - Automatically detect and convert between radians/degrees
- **Boundary containment** - Find which administrative boundaries contain a point
- **Distance-based lookup** - Find nearest geographic features within a radius
- **Metro area support** - Group boundaries into custom metropolitan regions
- **Multi-source comparison** - Compare geographic data across different sources
